# Vercel Build Fix - deleteUser Method Issue

## Issue Description
Vercel build is failing with the following error:
```
Property 'deleteUser' does not exist on type 'typeof SupabaseAdminService'.
```

Error occurs at: `./Cursorhelp-fix-profile-creation-and-user-management/app/dashboard/user-management/page.tsx:179:49`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `deleteUser` method exists in the `SupabaseAdminService` class in `lib/supabase-admin.ts`
2. The method is properly imported in the user-management page
3. The issue appears to be specific to the Vercel build environment
4. Local TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Investigation Results
- Method exists at line 178 in `lib/supabase-admin.ts`
- Proper import statement exists in user-management page
- Method signature: `static async deleteUser(userId: string, currentUserId: string)`
- Returns: `{ success: boolean, error: any }`

## Solution
The issue is likely related to TypeScript compilation in the Vercel environment or branch mismatch. The fix involves:

1. Ensuring the correct branch is deployed
2. Updating the remote branch to match main
3. Possibly adding explicit type annotations for better TypeScript resolution

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Merged feature branch with main
2. ✅ Updated remote branches to match main
3. ✅ Verified method exists and is properly exported
4. ✅ Local build passes (with ESLint warnings only)

## Next Steps
- Monitor next Vercel deployment
- If issue persists, consider explicit type annotations
- May need to check Vercel project configuration
